# ðŸ”’ VCL Firewall Access Solution

## **Issue Identified**
The Mini-task application is successfully deployed and running on the VCL server `152.7.177.154`, but external access is blocked by the VCL firewall.

## **Current Status**
âœ… **Backend**: Running on port 8000 (accessible locally)  
âœ… **Frontend**: Built and served by nginx on port 80 (accessible locally)  
âœ… **Database**: SQLite with 18 vectors in FAISS index  
âœ… **Enhanced RAG**: Fully operational  

## **Access Solutions**

### **Option 1: SSH Tunnel (Recommended)**
Create an SSH tunnel to access the application through your local machine:

```bash
# Tunnel port 80 (frontend) to your local port 8080
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 dsingh23@152.7.177.154

# In another terminal, tunnel port 8000 (backend API) to your local port 8001
ssh -L 8001:localhost:8000 dsingh23@152.7.177.154
```

Then access the application at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8001/health

### **Option 2: VCL Web Interface**
If your VCL environment provides a web interface, you can access the application through:
- **VCL Web Console**: Use the VCL web interface to access the server
- **VNC/Remote Desktop**: If available in your VCL environment

### **Option 3: Request VCL Admin Access**
Contact your VCL administrator to:
1. Open port 80 for external access
2. Configure port forwarding
3. Set up a public IP or domain

## **Application Verification**

The application is fully functional on the server:

```bash
# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test frontend
curl http://localhost/

# Test RAG system
curl http://localhost:8000/vector-stats
```

## **Next Steps**

1. **Use SSH tunnel** to access the application locally
2. **Test all features** including RAG functionality
3. **Consider alternative hosting** if VCL restrictions are permanent
4. **Document the deployment** for future reference

## **Alternative Hosting Options**

If VCL restrictions persist, consider:
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with free tier
- **Railway**: Simple container deployment
- **DigitalOcean**: Full control with reasonable pricing
- **AWS/GCP**: Enterprise-grade hosting
