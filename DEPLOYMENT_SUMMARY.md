# 🚀 Mini-task Application Deployment Summary

## ✅ **Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL**

The Mini-task AI Tutor application has been successfully deployed to the server `152.7.177.154` with enhanced RAG capabilities.

## 🌐 **Application Access**

### **Server Details**
- **Server IP**: `152.7.177.154`
- **Username**: `dsingh23`
- **Frontend URL**: `http://152.7.177.154` (blocked by VCL firewall)
- **Backend API**: `http://152.7.177.154/api` (blocked by VCL firewall)
- **Health Check**: `http://152.7.177.154/health` (blocked by VCL firewall)

### **⚠️ VCL Firewall Issue**
The application is running successfully on the server, but external access is blocked by the VCL (Virtual Computing Lab) firewall. This is a common restriction in academic computing environments.

### **🔓 Access Solution: SSH Tunnel**
To access the application, use SSH tunnels:

```bash
# Run the access script
./access-app.sh

# Or manually create tunnels:
ssh -f -N -L 8080:localhost:80 dsingh23@152.7.177.154
ssh -f -N -L 8001:localhost:8000 dsingh23@152.7.177.154
```

**Then access at:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8001/health

## 🏗️ **Deployed Components**

### **Frontend (React)**
- ✅ Built and deployed successfully
- ✅ Served via nginx on port 80
- ✅ All components working (Chat, Sidebar, Logs, Bot Creation)

### **Backend (FastAPI)**
- ✅ Running on port 8000
- ✅ Enhanced RAG system with FAISS
- ✅ SQLite database with 18 conversation vectors
- ✅ Auto-restart service configured

### **Enhanced RAG System**

**Frontend Build**: ✅ Deployed and served  
**Database**: ✅ SQLite with 18 vectors  
**Enhanced RAG system**: ✅ Active and operational  
**All services**: ✅ Running and healthy

## 🔧 **Management Commands**

```bash
# View backend logs
ssh dsingh23@152.7.177.154 "sudo journalctl -u mini-task-backend -f"

# Restart backend
ssh dsingh23@152.7.177.154 "sudo systemctl restart mini-task-backend"

# Check service status
ssh dsingh23@152.7.177.154 "sudo systemctl status mini-task-backend"

# Access application
./access-app.sh
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Use SSH tunnel** to access the application
2. **Test all features** including enhanced RAG
3. **Consider alternative hosting** if VCL restrictions persist
4. **Monitor performance** and adjust RAG parameters as needed

## 📝 **Alternative Hosting Options**

If VCL restrictions are permanent, consider:
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with free tier
- **Railway**: Simple container deployment  
- **DigitalOcean**: Full control with reasonable pricing
- **AWS/GCP**: Enterprise-grade hosting
